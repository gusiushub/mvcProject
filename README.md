**PHP-MVC is an MVC framework written for PHP 5.6. It is in very early development (it's being written
 alongside a web application) but is hoped to develop into a full framework in the process of creating
  said web app. Because of this it's wise to take the framework with a pinch of salt - nearly all the
   classes are documented and most of the core components work properly but there will only be as much
    documentation as is necessary to configure the framework. A sample app is coming soon.**
